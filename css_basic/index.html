            <h1>The most important thing in life</h1>
            <h2> What we thought we know best</h2>
            <p>People believe they are destined for great, some even dream big like their breat was a fossils made up of gold dust. Our parents heightens the hope. The mould it like their life depends on it, they want to support it like it is the saviour we have all been waiting for. We are made to be special. To garner the possiblities of becoming an asset. We are made to believe wealth is it alll</p>

            <h2>What we see</h2>
            <p>Is it a shock! or reality, we keeping marching forward, holding onto the core values while we march off to war. Been adapting and telling ourselves, "It is well". We keep believing that it will turn out into your reality. All you needed was keep pushing forward. Holding up those dreams, keeping it alive every night; that God will bless if only that will work, if only that figure will just say yes, if only I could get that job. Nonetheless, it would be time to wake up from those dreams less you are stuck in realty that will end up as a dream. The country, Nigeria will now have to plan your life.</p>
            <h2>The problem that defeat us</h2>
            <p>Now, you are full awake. You've realised help is not coming, you've realised that your position in life is far from the core of dreams you have kepts alive for quite long, be good, obey instructions, top your classes, be the best and end up jobless. There are bills waiting for you to pay, then you began to ask yourself if it were even worth it, all the sacrifices. You are defeated, you are stuck, and this time around everybody just hopes in you to be the saviour like you would be just that perfect person to connect, like you have been scammed; Depressions sets in, you are surrounded by people but you feel lonely, your desires becomes squashed by the reality you live in, even love cannot conquer your heart. Is it your problem? We are all in it together.</p>
            <h2>At last we found our base</h2>
            <p>Now you have realised "I wish" and "actually doing something" are two different concepts, "I want" and "I need" are of different importance. Then you renew your hope, amd make do with what you have or become something no one had imagined. The conqueror, the hustler, the best once more...for all life had done to you was prepare you for your own reality that you would mold and make with your own hands. Then the cycle continues with a new leaf that comes from your seed. What a world!</p>
